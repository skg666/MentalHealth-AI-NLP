# 🧠 Mental Health Detection Using NLP

This is an AI-based capstone project developed as part of the Edunet Foundation Internship Program.  
It aims to detect early signs of mental health issues like depression and anxiety from user-written text using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **BERT-based sentiment analysis**.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze textual inputs from users to determine emotional tone
- Classify the text as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**
- Enable early detection of mental health risks using AI

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Pre-trained BERT model  
- Azure AI Language (for reference in presentation)

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `mental_health_predictor.py` – main code for running sentiment analysis  
- `AI_Mental_Health_Project_Final_With_Photo.pptx` – presentation slides  
- (Optional) `PDF` version of the project slides
